The first thing I do to warm up my brain and introduce myself to new challenges is solve a Codewar! 

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor my code in order to optimize the codes efficiency and readability.

## Lessons Learned:

The most inportant lesson I learn by combating the near endless challenges in codewars is that there is always something to learn. Not knowing how to complete every challenge is okay, as long as you then take the time to learn how to complete the challenges placed in front of you.
